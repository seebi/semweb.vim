This is a syntax file to highlight Notation 3 documents for describing
RDF (meta-)data.

It handles basic highlighting, but has not currently any complex error
detecting features (e.g. for non-closed statements etc), nor any fold
regions defined.

About Notation 3 (excerpt from: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html):

"This is a language which is a compact and readable alternative to RDF's
XML syntax, but also is extended to allow greater expressiveness."

That said, download this and see if it helps you in semantic endeavours.

Comments, suggestions and assistance are all welcome!
